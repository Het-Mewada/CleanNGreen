          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
            Forests are essential to life on Earth. They provide clean air, regulate climate, prevent soil erosion, and are home to over 80% of terrestrial species. They act as the lungs of our planet, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Without them, ecosystems collapse and biodiversity declines.

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
            Reforestationâ€”the process of replanting trees in deforested areasâ€”is a key strategy in the fight against climate change. Trees act as carbon sinks, drawing down COâ‚‚ from the atmosphere. Forest restoration also revives degraded land, supports water cycles, and helps prevent desertification.

            <li><strong>Around 10 million hectares of forest</strong> are lost every yearâ€”about the size of Iceland.</li>
            <li><strong>Major causes:</strong> agriculture, logging, mining, urban expansion, and forest fires.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Habitat loss, soil erosion, carbon release, and extinction of flora and fauna.</li>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 text-lg space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Carbon Storage:</strong> One tree can absorb up to 48 pounds of COâ‚‚ per year.</li>
            <li><strong>Oxygen Production:</strong> An acre of trees can provide enough oxygen for 18 people annually.</li>
            <li><strong>Biodiversity Protection:</strong> Forests provide habitat for 70% of Earth's land animals and plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Filtration:</strong> Tree roots purify and regulate water supplies, reducing runoff and erosion.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate Control:</strong> Forests cool the Earth by releasing moisture and shading the ground.</li>

            <li><strong>Practice Sustainable Living:</strong> Use recycled paper, avoid palm oil, and eat sustainably.</li>
            <li><strong>Educate Others:</strong> Share information about deforestation and reforestation efforts.</li>

            <li><strong>Myth:</strong> "Tree planting alone will solve climate change." <br /> <strong>Reality:</strong> Reforestation is vital but must be part of a broader sustainability strategy.</li>
            <li><strong>Myth:</strong> "Only tropical forests matter." <br /> <strong>Reality:</strong> Boreal and temperate forests also play a huge role in carbon storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Myth:</strong> "New forests can replace old-growth forests." <br /> <strong>Reality:</strong> Old forests are irreplaceable in biodiversity and carbon storage capacity.</li>
